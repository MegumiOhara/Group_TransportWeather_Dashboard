## Week 3 Process 
We had a meeting and discussed our progress. Megumi completed the Address component and shared with the group (and later shared the API key for individual testing). Daniela used a different API for her departures that also includes the bus departures, Resrobot API, and tested the geocode and the component worked. However, the new API does not contain other transportsâ€™ departures, so it was discussed to add another API. Alejandra continued working on the Weather App. Faustina continued working on the Traffic Component using the Trafikveket API rather than Resrobot API. It was decided for Megumi to also work on the Extra Component- a joke component. Everyone also started working on their styling. It was decided to have 2 meetings on week 4 just in case there were other issues.
