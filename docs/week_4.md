## Week 4 Process 
We had a meeting before the weekend to showcase the progress made over the weekend. Faustina had issues over the weekend merging her branch to the main branch as there were merging conflicts. She made a new branch instead that avoided the conflict issues and now is in the styling stage of her component. Daniela is almost done with her component and now working on styling. Daniela has also started working on the skeleton loader. Alejandra has completed her function but there seems to be conflict issues when merging from the main to her branch â€“ there are node modules being added that are not needed. We decided to add gitignore file into the root directory as well. Megumi finished the Extra component and styling. It was discussed what the page should look like before inputting an address. It was decided that Daniela will see if she can make a new component that will be shown when the page is opened and before the Weather/Traffic information is shown. It was agreed to extend the group deadline of 31st October to 4th November and all branches will be merged that day.
